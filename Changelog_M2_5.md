\# Milestone 2.5 - ATR Trailing Stop Fix



\## Issue Addressed

\- Walter reported erratic/jittery ATR trailing stop behavior

\- Unwanted signal reversals (marked with red X in screenshots)

\- Stops moving against position ("jitter" line)



\## Solution Implemented

\- Integrated Harry's amaATRTrailingStop logic (step-ladder approach)

\- Stops now only move favorably (long stops up, short stops down)

\- One reversal per bar maximum

\- Signals filtered by trend direction



\## Key Changes

1\. Replaced ATR calculation logic

2\. Added proper trend tracking with preliminaryTrend/trend series

3\. Implemented stoppedOut flag for intrabar control

4\. Simplified to single "Show Stop Line" parameter

5\. Updated defaults: ATR Period=20, Multiplier=3.5
